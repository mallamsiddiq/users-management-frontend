## Project Overview

The Users Management Frontend is a React application that facilitates the management of user data. It interacts with a backend API (provided separately) to perform CRUD operations and provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to view, create, update, and delete user profiles.

The primary goal of this application is to offer a seamless user experience while managing user-related tasks, enhancing the efficiency of administrative workflows.

   - Display comprehensive details of a selected user.
   - Edit user information, including name, email, and other relevant details.

3. **User Creation:**
   - Add new users to the system through a user-friendly form.

4. **User Deletion:**
   - Remove users from the system, ensuring data consistency.

5. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensure a seamless experience on various devices by implementing a responsive design.
